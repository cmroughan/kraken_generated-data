# Sample Jupyter Notebooks

Written by Christine Roughan. Feel free to adapt if you find them useful.

The two Jupyter notebooks here offer 1) an example of Python code used to add characters to a sample text to have a more useful sample for OCR purposes and 2) an example of my results with Kraken using a workflow that relied on generated training data.
